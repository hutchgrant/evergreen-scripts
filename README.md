## Overview
Additional scripts for [evergreen applications](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/create-evergreen-app).

### Project Goals
Extending the functionality and usage of evergreen apps with additional scripts.

#### Under Development
This repo and Project Evergreen itself are still young and maturing rapidly.  The Project Evergreen GitHub organization [project tracker](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/project-evergreen/projects) captures the high level goals and next steps, with plans to keep adding those lessons learned as features and improvements to this repo.

## Serve apps via gh-pages

To make life easier and automate the task of deploying to gh-pages

Install

```
npm i -D evergreen-scripts
```

Make sure the project already has the remote repository setup:

```
git remote add YOUR_REPO
```

Modify your `package.json` by adding the script and your github pages url
```
"homepage": "https://hutchgrant.github.io/evergreen-web-components",
"scripts": {
    "gh-pages": "evergreen-scripts gh-pages"
}
```

Anytime you want to build/update the files being served on github pages, simply:

```
npm run gh-pages
```

The script will automatically:

1) (re)initialize git
2) create branch gh-pages, if master doesn't exist it will create an initial commit
3) add worktree dist with branch gh-pages
4) checkout orphan gh-pages
5) remove the initial files
6) create an additional webpack config for your github pages path
7) add a 404.html file that forwards to the index.html file so routing works as you would expect in a SPA.
8) build project
9) copy build files to work tree
10) commit to gh-pages branch
11) push to gh-pages branch.

### Troubleshooting

1) How do I reset my build to default? delete the dist folder and run the script again.
