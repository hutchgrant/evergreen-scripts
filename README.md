## Serve apps via gh-pages

To make life easier and automate the task of deploying to gh-pages

Install Evergreen Scripts

```
npm i -D evergreen-scripts
```

Add your remote github repository:

```
git remote add YOUR_REPO
```

Modify your `package.json` by adding the script and your github pages url
```
"homepage": "https://hutchgrant.github.io/evergreen-web-components/",
"scripts": {
    "gh-pages": "evergreen-scripts gh-pages"
}
```

Build, update, and serve files on github pages:

```
npm run gh-pages
```

The script will automatically:

1) (re)initialize git
2) create branch gh-pages, if master doesn't yet exist, it will create an initial commit
3) add git worktree dist with orphaned branch gh-pages
4) create a `ghpages.config.js` cache file containing a publicPath based on the `homepage` value in your package.json
4) create an additional webpack config for your github pages path
5) add a 404.html file that redirects to the index.html file so that routing works as you would expect in a SPA.
6) add a custom index.ghpages.html with a script to replace the state on client redirect
7) add a unique build script to your `package.json` file
8) build project using `webpack.config.ghpages.js`
8) git remove the previous files in gh-pages branch(`dist`)
9) copy build files to worktree(`dist`)
10) commit to gh-pages branch
11) push to gh-pages branch.
