## Serve apps via gh-pages

To make life easier and automate the task of deploying to gh-pages, we've created a simple script.

Add this script to your `package.json` with:

```
npm i evergreen-scripts
```

Add script in your `package.json`
```
"scripts": {
    "gh-pages": "evergreen-scripts gh-pages"
}
```

Anytime you want to update the files being served on github pages, simply:

```
npm run gh-pages
```

The script will automatically:

1) (re)initialize git
2) create branch gh-pages, if master doesn't exist it will create an initial commit
3) add worktree dist with branch gh-pages
4) checkout orphan gh-pages
5) remove the initial files
6) build project
7) copy build files to work tree
8) commit to gh-pages branch
9) push to gh-pages branch.
